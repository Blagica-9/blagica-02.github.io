            <h1> Sports </h1>
            <h3>Volleyball</h3>
            <p> When I grew up I had a desire for physical activity. I am the type of person who wants to have a healthy lifestyle, exercise and most of all I was interested in volleyball. I have been playing volleyball since I was 14 years old. I started training in a club in Prilep called October 11. At the same time as I was training there,
                I played in the women's volleyball team at my school. We made great progress, we were a generation that played with passion and we used every free moment to practice. In the last year of our primary education, we played in the national championship,
                but due to some omissions we did not make a result. When I enrolled in high school, the number of responsibilities increased, so I started playing volleyball only for recreation. I trained recreationally until last year. That year I had the opportunity to have the most wonderful coach of the whole period. I learned a lot in a short time. Due to the crown and the bad conditions we had, that team also fell apart and the coach left to play for his team. I do not play volleyball today.
                The volleyball teams I played for have fallen apart and many of the clubs I trained at do not have teams of my age. </p>

            <h3>Fitness</h3>
            <p>This year I started a different kind of physical activity. I started exercising in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/srce.zenski.fitnes.centar/"> women's fitness center "Heart" </a>.
                The trainings are very well organized. We work in groups of 5 to 10 women. We start with warming up and then exercises for certain parts of the body.
                Before I started, during the corona at home I practiced through an app that helped me prepare for the start with more intense workouts.
                We finish each workout with stretching. We have training three times a week and each training is determined for different parts of the body.
                In addition to fitness, I also ride a bike or run.</p>
